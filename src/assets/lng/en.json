    "intro1": "We have been dreaming about a place like Levendula apartment for a long time ago. The dream comes true in 2017. We grow up by the lake of Balaton and we wanted to share the feeling with the others. It took a long time to find the best place, but finally, we found an old house. We had to fully renovate it but it worth the time and the cost because we could customize the building on our own. During the renovation we tried to create a modern apartment with: instead of the old small porch we created two big terraces where you are able to have BBQ, there is a built-in air conditioner and it is suitable for heating too, the original walls are re-arranged and built-in new windows. The renovation took about a year, but it is not the end. When we do not have guests we continuously maintain the building and the garden as well.",
    "intro2": "So after renovation and customization, we could welcome our first guests in the summer of 2018. It was really exciting. We handed over the keys to our first guest with a heavy heart because during the year we fell in love with our little house but on the other hand, it was ready for the guests. However we take scheduled maintains we want to give you an easy booking solution, so you should have to have a good time during your holiday. Everybody in the family is helping us to maintain the apartment, for example, this website is made by our son. ",
    "intro3": "I hope during your holiday you would have enough time to discover the local sights or events. You can find some event ideas on this site. Thank you to reach us and visit our website. I hope we will see each other in the near future in the Levendula Apartman at Balatonmáriafürdő."
