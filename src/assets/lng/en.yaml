  introduction: Introduction
  intro1: >-
    We have been dreaming about a place like Levendula apartment for a long time
    ago. The dream comes true in 2017. We grow up by the lake of Balaton and we
    wanted to share the feeling with the others. It took a long time to find the
    best place, but finally, we found an old house. We had to fully renovate it
    but it worth the time and the cost because we could customize the building
    on our own. During the renovation we tried to create a modern apartment
    with: instead of the old small porch we created two big terraces where you
    are able to have BBQ, there is a built-in air conditioner and it is suitable
    for heating too, the original walls are re-arranged and built-in new
    windows. The renovation took about a year, but it is not the end. When we do
    not have guests we continuously maintain the building and the garden as
    well.
  intro2: >-
    So after renovation and customization, we could welcome our first guests in
    the summer of 2018. It was really exciting. We handed over the keys to our
    first guest with a heavy heart because during the year we fell in love with
    our little house but on the other hand, it was ready for the guests. However
    we take scheduled maintains we want to give you an easy booking solution, so
    you should have to have a good time during your holiday. Everybody in the
    family is helping us to maintain the apartment, for example, this website is
    made by our son.
  intro3: >-
    I hope during your holiday you would have enough time to discover the local
    sights or events. You can find some event ideas on this site. Thank you to
    reach us and visit our website. I hope we will see each other in the near
    future in the Levendula Apartman at Balatonmáriafürdő.
